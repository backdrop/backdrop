Fixes ISSUE_URL

<!-- Replace 'ISSUE_URL' above with the URL to the issue that this pull
request (PR) addresses. **Each PR must be linked to an issue** on
github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues, and most of the rationale, discussion,
and explanation should take place in the linked issue, rather than in this
PR. -->

<!-- Once you have submitted your PR, wait for the automated tests to run and
then check that they have all passed. If not, you should revise your PR until
they do. Tests will be automatically re-run after each commit. -->

<!-- When all of the automated checks have passed, post a comment in the
linked issue stating that the PR is ready to be reviewed/tested. If you have
the GitHub privileges to do so, you can mark the issue with the labels
"status - has pull request", "PR - needs testing", and "PR - needs code
review." -->
