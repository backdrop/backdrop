# You can use this file to easily spin up a development stack for your Backdrop
# sites using the Lando dev stack.
#
# Lando is a free, open source and cross-platform local development environment
# tool built on Docker container technology. It is the successor project to
# Kalabox.
#
# You can read more about the lando project and its full capabilities here:
# https://docs.lndo.io/

# Change this to your sitename like `my-project` or `sso-company`.
# Backdrop recipe
name: my-backdrop

# Start with the default Backdrop recipe
recipe: backdrop

# Configure the Backdrop recipe
config:

  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements

  # Optionally specify the php version to use.
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest php version supported by Backdrop.
  # Consult the `php` service to see what versions are available. Note that all
  # such versions may not be supported in Backdrop 6 so YMMV.
  #
  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements
  #
  # NOTE: that this needs to be wrapped in quotes so that it is a string
  #
  # You can use one of '5.3', '5.5', '5.6', '7.0' or '7.1' here for PHP
  # versions.
  #
  php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve Backdrop via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  #
  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements

  # Optionally specify the location of the webroot relative to your approot.
  #
  # If ommitted this will be your approot itself.

  # Optionally specify the version of Backdrush you want for your site
  #
  # This can be either
  #   - `stable`
  #   - `dev`

  #
  # If ommitted this will use the stable Backdrush.
  #
  backdrush: stable

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:
  #
  #   - `mysql`
  #   - `mariadb`

  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements
  #
  database: mariadb

  # Optionally activate xdebug
  xdebug: true

  # conf:
    # server: config/backdrop.conf
