Initial release of [Backdrop CMS](https://backdropcms.org/)

Backdrop is a full featured CMS with a focus on small-medium businesses,
education, and non-profits. It is a fork of the Drupal project, with a
highly-compatible API to that of Drupal 7. This release includes 3 major
enhancements over Drupal 7, including:
- Full Configuration Management (easy deploying between environments)
- Built-in Views Module (dynamic list generator)
- All-new Layout Module (similar to Panels in Drupal 7)

Besides these major changes, Backdrop contains dozens of other improvements
throughout: an enhanced entity system, new AJAX dialog system, HTML5 elements,
updated libraries, built-in administration bar, and more!
