Description
-----------

Backdrop is a fully-featured content management system that allows non-technical
users to manage a wide-variety of content. It can be used to create blogs,
forums, image galleries, social networks, intranets, and more.

Backdrop aims to provide:

- A full-featured CMS that puts editorial and end-users first.
- A system that can be utilized out-of-the-box.
- Code that can be learned and easily developed.
- Extensible APIs.

Requirements
------------
- PHP 5.3.2 or higher
- MySQL 5.0.15 or PostgreSQL 8.3 or higher with PDO enabled

Installation
------------

1. Create a new database, username, and password for Backdrop to use in MySQL
   or PostgreSQL.

2. Point your browser at the URL of your Backdrop installation. On Apache web
   servers, you will be directed to the install screen. If you're not
   redirected, visit the install URL. If Backdrop was installed at
