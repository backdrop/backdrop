/**
 * @defgroup lock Locking mechanisms
 * @{
 * Functions to coordinate long-running operations across requests.
 *
 * In most environments, multiple Backdrop page requests (a.k.a. threads or
 * processes) will execute in parallel. This leads to potential conflicts or
 * race conditions when two requests execute the same code at the same time. A
 * common example of this is a rebuild like menu_rebuild() where we invoke many
 * hook implementations to get and process data from all active modules, and
 * then delete the current data in the database to insert the new afterwards.
 *
 * This is a cooperative, advisory lock system. Any long-running operation
 * that could potentially be attempted in parallel by multiple requests should
 * try to acquire a lock before proceeding. By obtaining a lock, one request
 * notifies any other requests that a specific operation is in progress which
 * must not be executed in parallel.
 *
 * To use this API, pick a unique name for the lock. A sensible choice is the
 * name of the function performing the operation. A very simple example use of
 * this API:
 * @code
 * function mymodule_long_operation() {
 *   if (lock_acquire('mymodule_long_operation')) {
 *     // Do the long operation here.
 *     // ...
 *     lock_release('mymodule_long_operation');
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If a function acquires a lock it should always release it when the
 * operation is complete by calling lock_release(), as in the example.
 *
 * A function that has acquired a lock may attempt to renew a lock (extend the
 * duration of the lock) by calling lock_acquire() again during the operation.
 * Failure to renew a lock is indicative that another request has acquired
 * the lock, and that the current operation may need to be aborted.
 *
 * If a function fails to acquire a lock it may either immediately return, or
 * it may call lock_wait() if the rest of the current page request requires
 * that the operation in question be complete. After lock_wait() returns,
 * the function may again attempt to acquire the lock, or may allow the page
 * request to proceed on the assumption that a parallel request completed the
 * operation.
 *
 * lock_acquire() and lock_wait() will automatically break (delete) a lock
 * whose duration has exceeded the timeout specified when it was acquired.
 *
 * Alternative implementations of this API (such as APC) may be substituted
 * by changing the $settings['lock_inc'] variable to an include filepath. Since
 * this is an API intended to support alternative implementations, code using
 * this API should never rely upon specific implementation details (for example
 * no code should look for or directly modify a lock in the {semaphore} table).
