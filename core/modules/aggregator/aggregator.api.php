 *   contains the raw feed data. The hook implementation should parse this data

 *   - link: A full URL that directly relates to the feed.
 *   - image: An image URL used to display an image of the feed.
 *   - etag: An entity tag from the HTTP header used for cache validation to
 *     determine if the content has been changed.
 *   - modified: The UNIX timestamp when the feed was last modified.
 *   - items: An array of feed items. The common format for a single feed item
 *     is an associative array containing:
 *     - title: The human-readable title of the feed item.
 *     - description: The full body text of the item or a summary.
 *     - timestamp: The UNIX timestamp when the feed item was last published.
 *     - author: The author of the feed item.
 *     - guid: The global unique identifier (GUID) string that uniquely
 *       identifies the item. If not available, the link is used to identify
 *       the item.
 *     - link: A full URL to the individual feed item.
