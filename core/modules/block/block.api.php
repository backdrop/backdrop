/**
 * Define all blocks provided by the module.
 *
 * This hook declares to Drupal what blocks are provided by your module and can
 * optionally specify initial block configuration settings.
 *
 * In hook_block_info(), each block your module provides is given a unique
 * identifier referred to as "delta" (the array key in the return value). Delta
 * values only need to be unique within your module, and they are used in the
 * following ways:
 * - Passed into the other block hooks in your module as an argument to identify
 *   the block being configured or viewed.
 * - Used to construct the default HTML ID of "block-MODULE-DELTA" applied to
 *   each block when it is rendered. This ID may then be used for CSS styling or
 *   JavaScript programming.
 * - Used to define a theming template suggestion of block__MODULE__DELTA, for
 *   advanced theming possibilities.
 * - Used by other modules to identify your block in hook_block_info_alter() and
 *   other alter hooks.
 * The values of delta can be strings or numbers, but because of the uses above
 * it is preferable to use descriptive strings whenever possible, and only use a
 * numeric identifier if you have to (for instance if your module allows users
 * to create several similar blocks that you identify within your module code
 * with numeric IDs). The maximum length for delta values is 32 bytes.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array whose keys define the delta for each block and whose
 *   values contain the block descriptions. Each block description is itself an
 *   associative array, with the following key-value pairs:
 *   - info: (required) The human-readable administrative name of the block.
 *     This is used to identify the block on administration screens, and
 *     is not displayed to non-administrative users.
 *   - cache: (optional) A bitmask describing what kind of caching is
 *     appropriate for the block. Drupal provides the following bitmask
 *     constants for defining cache granularity:
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_ROLE (default): The block can change depending on the
 *       roles the user viewing the page belongs to.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_USER: The block can change depending on the user
 *       viewing the page. This setting can be resource-consuming for sites
 *       with large number of users, and should only be used when
 *       DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_ROLE is not sufficient.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_PER_PAGE: The block can change depending on the page
 *       being viewed.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_GLOBAL: The block is the same for every user on every
 *       page where it is visible.
 *     - DRUPAL_CACHE_CUSTOM: The module implements its own caching system.
 *     - DRUPAL_NO_CACHE: The block should not get cached.
 *   - properties: (optional) Array of additional metadata to add to the block.
 *     Common properties include:
 *     - administrative: Boolean that categorizes this block as usable in an
 *       administrative context. This might include blocks that help an
 *       administrator approve/deny comments, or view recently created user
 *       accounts.
 *   - weight: (optional) Initial value for the ordering weight of this block.
 *     Most modules do not provide an initial value, and any value provided can
 *     be modified by a user on the block configuration screen.
 *   - status: (optional) Initial value for block enabled status. (1 = enabled,
 *     0 = disabled). An initial value for 'region' is required for 'status' to
 *     take effect.
 *     Most modules do not provide an initial value, and any value provided can
 *     be modified by a user on the block configuration screen.
 *   - region: (optional) Initial value for theme region within which this block
 *     is set. If the specified region is not available in a theme, the block
 *     will be disabled. The initial value for 'status' must be enabled or the
 *     initial region value is ignored.
 *     Most modules do not provide an initial value, and any value provided can
 *     be modified by a user on the block configuration screen.
 *   - visibility: (optional) Initial value for the visibility flag, which tells
 *     how to interpret the 'pages' value. Possible values are:
 *     - BLOCK_VISIBILITY_NOTLISTED: Show on all pages except listed pages.
 *       'pages' lists the paths where the block should not be shown.
 *     - BLOCK_VISIBILITY_LISTED: Show only on listed pages. 'pages' lists the
 *       paths where the block should be shown.
 *     - BLOCK_VISIBILITY_PHP: Use custom PHP code to determine visibility.
 *       'pages' gives the PHP code to use.
 *     Most modules do not provide an initial value for 'visibility' or 'pages',
 *     and any value provided can be modified by a user on the block
 *     configuration screen.
 *   - pages: (optional) See 'visibility' above. A string that contains one or
 *     more page paths separated by "\n", "\r", or "\r\n" when 'visibility' is
 *     set to BLOCK_VISIBILITY_NOTLISTED or BLOCK_VISIBILITY_LISTED (example:
 *     "<front>\nnode/1"), or custom PHP code when 'visibility' is set to
 *     BLOCK_VISIBILITY_PHP. Paths may use '*' as a wildcard (matching any
 *     number of characters); '<front>' designates the site's front page. For
 *     BLOCK_VISIBILITY_PHP, the PHP code's return value should be TRUE if the
 *     block is to be made visible or FALSE if the block should not be visible.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see block_example.module.
