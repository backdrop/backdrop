/**
 * Inform the base system and the Field API about one or more entity types.
 *
 * Inform the system about one or more entity types (i.e., object types that
 * can be loaded via entity_load() and, optionally, to which fields can be
 * attached).
 *
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are entity type names and whose values identify
 *   properties of those types that the system needs to know about:
 *   - label: The human-readable name of the type.
 *   - controller class: The name of the class that is used to load the objects.
 *     The class has to implement the DrupalEntityControllerInterface interface.
 *     Leave blank to use the DrupalDefaultEntityController implementation.
 *   - base table: (used by DrupalDefaultEntityController) The name of the
 *     entity type's base table.
 *   - static cache: (used by DrupalDefaultEntityController) FALSE to disable
 *     static caching of entities during a page request. Defaults to TRUE.
 *   - field cache: (used by Field API loading and saving of field data) FALSE
 *     to disable Field API's persistent cache of field data. Only recommended
 *     if a higher level persistent cache is available for the entity type.
 *     Defaults to TRUE.
 *   - load hook: The name of the hook which should be invoked by
 *     DrupalDefaultEntityController:attachLoad(), for example 'node_load'.
 *   - fieldable: Set to TRUE if you want your entity type to be fieldable.
 *   - translation: An associative array of modules registered as field
 *     translation handlers. Array keys are the module names, array values
 *     can be any data structure the module uses to provide field translation.
 *     Any empty value disallows the module to appear as a translation handler.
 *   - entity keys: An array describing how the Field API can extract the
 *     information it needs from the objects of the type. Elements:
 *     - id: The name of the property that contains the primary id of the
 *       entity. Every entity object passed to the Field API must have this
 *       property and its value must be numeric.
 *     - revision: The name of the property that contains the revision id of
 *       the entity. The Field API assumes that all revision ids are unique
 *       across all entities of a type. This entry can be omitted if the
 *       entities of this type are not versionable.
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the bundle name for the
 *       entity. The bundle name defines which set of fields are attached to
 *       the entity (e.g. what nodes call "content type"). This entry can be
 *       omitted if this entity type exposes a single bundle (all entities have
 *       the same collection of fields). The name of this single bundle will be
 *       the same as the entity type.
 *   - bundle keys: An array describing how the Field API can extract the
 *     information it needs from the bundle objects for this type (e.g
 *     $vocabulary objects for terms; not applicable for nodes). This entry can
 *     be omitted if this type's bundles do not exist as standalone objects.
 *     Elements:
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the name of the bundle
 *       object.
 *   - bundles: An array describing all bundles for this object type. Keys are
 *     bundles machine names, as found in the objects' 'bundle' property
 *     (defined in the 'entity keys' entry above). Elements:
 *     - label: The human-readable name of the bundle.
 *     - admin: An array of information that allows Field UI pages to attach
 *       themselves to the existing administration pages for the bundle.
 *       Elements:
 *       - path: the path of the bundle's main administration page, as defined
 *         in hook_menu(). If the path includes a placeholder for the bundle,
 *         the 'bundle argument', 'bundle helper' and 'real path' keys below
 *         are required.
 *       - bundle argument: The position of the placeholder in 'path', if any.
 *       - real path: The actual path (no placeholder) of the bundle's main
 *         administration page. This will be used to generate links.
 *       - access callback: As in hook_menu(). 'user_access' will be assumed if
 *         no value is provided.
 *       - access arguments: As in hook_menu().
 *   - view modes: An array describing the view modes for the entity type. View
 *     modes let entities be displayed differently depending on the context.
 *     For instance, a node can be displayed differently on its own page
 *     ('full' mode), on the home page or taxonomy listings ('teaser' mode), or
 *     in an RSS feed ('rss' mode). Modules taking part in the display of the
 *     entity (notably the Field API) can adjust their behavior depending on
 *     the requested view mode. An additional 'default' view mode is available
 *     for all entity types. This view mode is not intended for actual entity
 *     display, but holds default display settings. For each available view
 *     mode, administrators can configure whether it should use its own set of
 *     field display settings, or just replicate the settings of the 'default'
 *     view mode, thus reducing the amount of display configurations to keep
 *     track of. Keys of the array are view mode names. Each view mode is
 *     described by an array with the following key/value pairs:
 *     - label: The human-readable name of the view mode
 *     - custom settings: A boolean specifying whether the view mode should by
 *       default use its own custom field display settings. If FALSE, entities
 *       displayed in this view mode will reuse the 'default' display settings
 *       by default (e.g. right after the module exposing the view mode is
 *       enabled), but administrators can later use the Field UI to apply custom
 *       display settings specific to the view mode.

 *   Note the $query->altered attribute which is TRUE in case the query has
