/**
 * Inform the base system and the Field API about one or more entity types.
 *
 * Inform the system about one or more entity types (i.e., object types that
 * can be loaded via entity_load() and, optionally, to which fields can be
 * attached).
 *
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are entity type names and whose values identify
 *   properties of those types that the system needs to know about:
 *   - label: The human-readable name of the type.
 *   - entity class: A class that the controller will use for instantiating
 *     entities. Must extend the Entity class or implement EntityInterface.
 *   - controller class: The name of the class that is used to load the objects.
 *     The class has to implement the EntityControllerInterface interface.
 *     Leave blank to use the DefaultEntityController implementation.
 *   - base table: (used by DefaultEntityController) The name of the
 *     entity type's base table.
 *   - static cache: (used by DefaultEntityController) FALSE to disable
 *     static caching of entities during a page request. Defaults to TRUE.
 *   - field cache: (used by Field API loading and saving of field data) FALSE
 *     to disable Field API's persistent cache of field data. Only recommended
 *     if a higher level persistent cache is available for the entity type.
 *     Defaults to TRUE.
 *   - load hook: The name of the hook which should be invoked by
 *     DefaultEntityController:attachLoad(), for example 'node_load'.
 *   - fieldable: Set to TRUE if you want your entity type to be fieldable.
 *   - translation: An associative array of modules registered as field
 *     translation handlers. Array keys are the module names, array values
 *     can be any data structure the module uses to provide field translation.
 *     Any empty value disallows the module to appear as a translation handler.
 *   - entity keys: An array describing additional information about the entity.
 *     This is used by both the EntityFieldQuery class and the Field API.
 *     EntityFieldQuery assumes at the very least that the id is always present.
 *     The Field API uses this array to extract the information it needs from
 *     the objects of the type. Elements:
 *     - id: The name of the property that contains the primary id of the
 *       entity. Every entity object passed to the Field API must have this
 *       property and its value must be numeric.
 *     - revision: The name of the property that contains the revision id of
 *       the entity. The Field API assumes that all revision ids are unique
 *       across all entities of a type. This entry can be omitted if the
 *       entities of this type are not versionable. Defaults to an empty string.
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the bundle name for the
 *       entity. The bundle name defines which set of fields are attached to
 *       the entity (e.g. what nodes call "content type"). This entry can be
 *       omitted if this entity type exposes a single bundle (all entities have
 *       the same collection of fields). The name of this single bundle will be
 *       the same as the entity type.
 *   - bundle keys: An array describing how the Field API can extract the
 *     information it needs from the bundle objects for this type (e.g
 *     $vocabulary objects for terms; not applicable for nodes). This entry can
 *     be omitted if this type's bundles do not exist as standalone objects.
 *     Elements:
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the name of the bundle
 *       object.
 *   - bundles: An array describing all bundles for this object type. Keys are
 *     bundles machine names, as found in the objects' 'bundle' property
 *     (defined in the 'entity keys' entry above). This entry can be omitted if
 *     this entity type exposes a single bundle (all entities have the same
 *     collection of fields). The name of this single bundle will be the same as
 *     the entity type. Defaults to an empty string. Elements:
 *     - label: The human-readable name of the bundle.
 *     - admin: An array of information that allows Field UI pages to attach
 *       themselves to the existing administration pages for the bundle.
 *       Elements:
 *       - path: the path of the bundle's main administration page, as defined
 *         in hook_menu(). If the path includes a placeholder for the bundle,
 *         the 'bundle argument', 'bundle helper' and 'real path' keys below
 *         are required.
 *       - bundle argument: The position of the placeholder in 'path', if any.
 *       - real path: The actual path (no placeholder) of the bundle's main
 *         administration page. This will be used to generate links.
 *       - access callback: As in hook_menu(). 'user_access' will be assumed if
 *         no value is provided.
 *       - access arguments: As in hook_menu().
 *   - view modes: An array describing the display modes for the entity type.
 *     Display modes let entities be displayed differently depending on the
 *     context. For instance, a node can be displayed differently on its own
 *     page ('full' mode), on the home page or taxonomy listings ('teaser'
 *     mode), or in an RSS feed ('rss' mode). Modules taking part in the display
 *     of the entity (notably the Field API) can adjust their behavior depending
 *     on the requested display mode. An additional 'default' display mode is
 *     available for all entity types. This display mode is not intended for
 *     actual entity display, but holds default display settings. For each
 *     available display mode, administrators can configure whether it should use
 *     its own set of field display settings, or just replicate the settings of
 *     the 'default' display mode, thus reducing the amount of display
 *     configurations to keep track of. Keys of the array are display mode
 *     names. Each display mode is described by an array with the following
 *     key/value pairs:
 *     - label: The human-readable name of the display mode
 *     - custom settings: A boolean specifying whether the display mode should
 *       by default use its own custom field display settings. If FALSE,
 *       entities displayed in this display mode will reuse the 'default'
 *       display settings by default (e.g. right after the module exposing the
 *       display mode is enabled), but administrators can later use the Field UI
 *       to apply custom display settings specific to the display mode.
