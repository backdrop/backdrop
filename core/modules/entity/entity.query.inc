/**
 * Retrieves entities matching a given set of conditions.
 *
 * This class allows finding entities based on entity properties (for example,
 * node->changed), field values, and generic entity meta data (bundle,
 * entity type, entity id, and revision ID). It is not possible to query across
 * multiple entity types. For example, there is no facility to find published
 * nodes written by users created in the last hour, as this would require
 * querying both node->status and user->created.
 *
 * Normally we would not want to have public properties on the object, as that
 * allows the object's state to become inconsistent too easily. However, this
 * class's standard use case involves primarily code that does need to have
 * direct access to the collected properties in order to handle alternate
 * execution routines. We therefore use public properties for simplicity. Note
 * that code that is simply creating and running a field query should still use
 * the appropriate methods to add conditions on the query.
 *
 * Storage engines are not required to support every type of query. By default,
 * an EntityFieldQueryException will be raised if an unsupported condition is
 * specified or if the query has field conditions or sorts that are stored in
 * different field storage engines. However, this logic can be overridden in
 * hook_entity_query_alter().
 *
 * Also note that this query does not automatically respect entity access
 * restrictions. Node access control is performed by the SQL storage engine but
 * other storage engines might not do this.
