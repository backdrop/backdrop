 *     when adding or configuring this image effect.
 *   - "form callback": (optional) The name of a function that will return a
 *     $form array providing a configuration form for this image effect.
 *   - "summary theme": (optional) The name of a theme function that will output
 *     a summary of this image effect's configuration.

 * Modify any image styles provided by other modules or the user.

 * that a specific effect is always enabled on a style. Note that modifications
 * to these styles may negatively affect the user experience, such as if an
 * effect is added to a style through this hook, the user may attempt to remove
 * the effect but it will be immediately be re-added.
 *
 * The best use of this hook is usually to modify default styles, which are not
 * editable by the user until they are overridden, so such interface
 * contradictions will not occur. This hook can target default (or user) styles
 * by checking the $style['storage'] property.
 *
 * If your module needs to provide a new style (rather than modify an existing
 * one) use hook_image_default_styles() instead.

/**
 * Provide module-based image styles for reuse throughout Drupal.
 *
 * This hook allows your module to provide image styles. This may be useful if
 * you require images to fit within exact dimensions. Note that you should
 * attempt to re-use the default styles provided by Image module whenever
 * possible, rather than creating image styles that are specific to your module.
 * Image provides the styles "thumbnail", "medium", and "large".
 *
 * You may use this hook to more easily manage your site's changes by moving
 * existing image styles from the database to a custom module. Note however that
 * moving image styles to code instead storing them in the database has a
 * negligible effect on performance, since custom image styles are loaded
 * from the database all at once. Even if all styles are pulled from modules,
 * Image module will still perform the same queries to check the database for
 * any custom styles.

 *   An array of image styles, keyed by the style name.
