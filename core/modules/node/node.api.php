 * Functions to define and modify content types.
 *
 * Each content type is maintained by a primary module, which is either
 * node.module (for content types created in the user interface) or the module
 * that implements hook_node_info() to define the content type.
 *
 * During node operations (create, update, view, delete, etc.), there are
 * several sets of hooks that get invoked to allow modules to modify the base
 * node operation:
 * - Node-type-specific hooks: These hooks are only invoked on the primary
 *   module, using the "base" return component of hook_node_info() as the
 *   function prefix.
 * - All-module hooks: This set of hooks is invoked on all implementing modules,
 *   to allow other modules to modify what the primary node module is doing. For
 *   example, hook_node_insert() is invoked on all modules when creating a book
 *   node.
 * - Field hooks: Hooks related to the fields attached to the node. These are
 *   invoked from the field operations functions described below, and can be
 *   either field-type-specific or all-module hooks.
 * - Entity hooks: Generic hooks for "entity" operations. These are always
 *   invoked on all modules.
 *
 * Here is a list of the node and entity hooks that are invoked, field
 * operations, and other steps that take place during node operations:
 * - Creating a new node (calling node_save() on a new node):
 *   - field_attach_presave()
 *   - hook_node_presave() (all)

/**
 * Inform the node access system what permissions the user has.
 *
 * This hook is for implementation by node access modules. In this hook,
 * the module grants a user different "grant IDs" within one or more
 * "realms". In hook_node_access_records(), the realms and grant IDs are
 * associated with permission to view, edit, and delete individual nodes.
 *
 * The realms and grant IDs can be arbitrarily defined by your node access
 * module; it is common to use role IDs as grant IDs, but that is not required.
 * Your module could instead maintain its own list of users, where each list has
 * an ID. In that case, the return value of this hook would be an array of the
 * list IDs that this user is a member of.
 *
 * A node access module may implement as many realms as necessary to properly
 * define the access privileges for the nodes. Note that the system makes no
 * distinction between published and unpublished nodes. It is the module's
 * responsibility to provide appropriate realms to limit access to unpublished
 * content.
 *
 * Node access records are stored in the {node_access} table and define which
 * grants are required to access a node. There is a special case for the view
 * operation -- a record with node ID 0 corresponds to a "view all" grant for
 * the realm and grant ID of that record. If there are no node access modules
 * enabled, the core node module adds a node ID 0 record for realm 'all'. Node
 * access modules can also grant "view all" permission on their custom realms;
 * for example, a module could create a record in {node_access} with:
 * @code
 * $record = array(
 *   'nid' => 0,
 *   'gid' => 888,
 *   'realm' => 'example_realm',
 *   'grant_view' => 1,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 * );
 * drupal_write_record('node_access', $record);
 * @endcode
 * And then in its hook_node_grants() implementation, it would need to return:
 * @code
 * if ($op == 'view') {
 *   $grants['example_realm'] = array(888);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * If you decide to do this, be aware that the node_access_rebuild() function
 * will erase any node ID 0 entry when it is called, so you will need to make
 * sure to restore your {node_access} record after node_access_rebuild() is
 * called.
 *
 * @param $account
 *   The user object whose grants are requested.
 * @param $op
 *   The node operation to be performed, such as 'view', 'update', or 'delete'.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are "realms" of grants, and whose values are arrays of
 *   the grant IDs within this realm that this user is being granted.
 *
 * For a detailed example, see node_access_example.module.
 *
 * @see node_access_view_all_nodes()
 * @see node_access_rebuild()

/**
 * Set permissions for a node to be written to the database.
 *
 * When a node is saved, a module implementing hook_node_access_records() will
 * be asked if it is interested in the access permissions for a node. If it is
 * interested, it must respond with an array of permissions arrays for that
 * node.
 *
 * Node access grants apply regardless of the published or unpublished status
 * of the node. Implementations must make sure not to grant access to
 * unpublished nodes if they don't want to change the standard access control
 * behavior. Your module may need to create a separate access realm to handle
 * access to unpublished nodes.
 *
 * Note that the grant values in the return value from your hook must be
 * integers and not boolean TRUE and FALSE.
 *
 * Each permissions item in the array is an array with the following elements:
 * - 'realm': The name of a realm that the module has defined in
 *   hook_node_grants().
 * - 'gid': A 'grant ID' from hook_node_grants().
 * - 'grant_view': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can view this node. This should usually be
 *   set to $node->status. Failure to do so may expose unpublished content
 *   to some users.
 * - 'grant_update': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can edit this node.
 * - 'grant_delete': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can delete this node.
 *
 *
 * When an implementation is interested in a node but want to deny access to
 * everyone, it may return a "deny all" grant:
 *
 * @code
 * $grants[] = array(
 *   'realm' => 'all',
 *   'gid' => 0,
 *   'grant_view' => 0,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 *   'priority' => 1,
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Setting the priority should cancel out other grants. In the case of a
 * conflict between modules, it is safer to use hook_node_access_records_alter()
 * to return only the deny grant.
 *
 * Note: a deny all grant is not written to the database; denies are implicit.
 *
 * @param Node $node
 *   The node that has just been saved.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of grants as defined above.

 * must return a value between 0 and 1 for every node. That value is then

 *     joined to by the base query, such as for the {node} table. Other tables
 *     should use the full table name as an alias to avoid naming collisions.
 *   - score: (required) The part of a query string to calculate the score for
 *     the ranking mechanism based on values in the database. This does not need
 *     to be wrapped in parentheses, as it will be done automatically; it also
 *     does not need to take the weighted system into account, as it will be
 *     done automatically. It does, however, need to calculate a decimal between
 *     0 and 1; be careful not to cast the entire score to an integer by
