/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a node.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - $title: the (sanitized) title of the node.
 * - $content: An array of node items. Use render($content) to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as render($content['field_example']). Use
 *   hide($content['field_example']) to temporarily suppress the printing of a
 *   given element.
 * - $user_picture: The node author's picture from user-picture.tpl.php.
 * - $date: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can reformat it by
 *   calling format_date() with the desired parameters on the $created variable.
 * - $name: Themed username of node author output from theme_username().
 * - $node_url: Direct URL of the current node.
 * - $display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
 * - $submitted: Submission information created from $name and $date during
 *   template_preprocess_node().
 * - $classes: Array of classes that can be used to style contextually through
 *   CSS. The default values can be one or more of the following:
 *   - node: The current template type; for example, "theming hook".
 *   - node-[type]: The current node type. For example, if the node is a
 *     "Post" it would result in "node-post". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the node e.g. teaser or full.
 *   - preview: Nodes in preview mode.
 *   The following are controlled through the node publishing options.
 *   - promoted: Nodes that are promoted.
 *   - sticky: Nodes ordered above other non-sticky nodes in teaser
 *     listings.
 *   - unpublished: Unpublished nodes visible only to administrators.
 * - $attributes: Array of additional HTML attributes that should be added to
 *   the wrapper element. Flatten with backdrop_attributes().
 * - $title_prefix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed in front of the main title tag that
 *   appears in the template.
 * - $title_suffix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in
 *   the template.
 *
 * Other variables:
 * - $node: Full node entity. Contains data that may not be safe.
 * - $type: Node type; for example, post, page, blog, etc.
 * - $uid: User ID of the node author.
 * - $created: Time the node was published formatted in Unix timestamp.
 * - $zebra: Outputs either "even" or "odd". Useful for zebra striping in
 *   teaser listings.
 * - $id: Position of the node. Increments each time it's output.
 * - $comment_count: Number of comments attached to the node.
 * - $comments: The comment-related elements for the node. Contains two values
 *   that are both arrays that need to be rendered through a render() call:
 *   - $comments['comments']: Comments for this node.
 *   - $comments['comment_form']: Form for adding a new comment.
 * - $comment_display_mode: Whether comments are threaded or not, one of the
 *   following PHP constants:
 *   - COMMENT_MODE_FLAT
 *   - COMMENT_MODE_THREADED
 *
 * Node status variables:
 * - $view_mode: Display mode, e.g. 'full', or 'teaser'.
 * - $teaser: Flag for the teaser state (shortcut for $view_mode == 'teaser').
 * - $page: Flag for the full page state.
 * - $promote: Flag for front page promotion state.
 * - $sticky: Flags for sticky post setting.
 * - $status: Flag for published status.
 * - $comment: State of comment settings for the node.
 * - $readmore: Flags true if the teaser content of the node cannot hold the
 *   main body content.
 * - $is_front: Flags true when presented in the front page.
 * - $logged_in: Flags true when the current user is a logged-in member.
 * - $is_admin: Flags true when the current user is an administrator.
 *
 * Field variables: for each field instance attached to the node a corresponding
 * variable is defined; for example, $node->body becomes $body. When needing to
 * access a field's raw values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to
 * use these variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the
 * desired field language; for example, $node->body['en'], thus overriding any
 * language negotiation rule that was previously applied.
