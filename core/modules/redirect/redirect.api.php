 * @{
 * During redirect operations (create, update, view, delete, etc.), there are
 * several sets of hooks that get invoked to allow modules to modify the
 * redirect operation:
 * - All-module hooks: Generic hooks for "redirect" operations. These are
 *   always invoked on all modules.
 * - Entity hooks: Generic hooks for "entity" operations. These are always
 *   invoked on all modules.
 *
 * Here is a list of the redirect and entity hooks that are invoked, and other
 * steps that take place during redirect operations:
 * - Creating a new redirect (calling redirect_save() on a new redirect):
 *   - hook_redirect_presave() (all)
 *   - Redirect written to the database
 *   - hook_redirect_insert() (all)
 *   - hook_entity_insert() (all)
 * - Updating an existing redirect (calling redirect_save() on an existing redirect):
 *   - hook_redirect_presave() (all)
 *   - Redirect written to the database
 *   - hook_redirect_update() (all)
 *   - hook_entity_update() (all)
 * - Loading a redirect (calling redirect_load(), redirect_load_multiple(), or
 *   entity_load() with $entity_type of 'redirect'):
 *   - Redirect information is read from database.
 *   - hook_entity_load() (all)
 *   - hook_redirect_load() (all)
 * - Deleting a redirect (calling redirect_delete() or redirect_delete_multiple()):
 *   - Redirect is loaded (see Loading section above)
 *   - Redirect information is deleted from database
 *   - hook_redirect_delete() (all)
 *   - hook_entity_delete() (all)
 * - Preparing a redirect for editing (note that if it's
 *   an existing redirect, it will already be loaded; see the Loading section
 *   above):
 *   - hook_redirect_prepare() (all)
 * - Validating a redirect during editing form submit (calling
 *   redirect_form_validate()):
 *   - hook_redirect_validate() (all)

/**
 * Act on redirects being loaded from the database.

 * This hook is invoked during redirect loading, which is handled by
 * entity_load(), via classes RedirectController and
 * DefaultEntityController. After the redirect information is read from
 * the database or the entity cache, hook_entity_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules, and then hook_redirect_load() is invoked on all
 * implementing modules.
 *
 * This hook should only be used to add information that is not in the redirect
 * table, not to replace information that is in that table (which could
 * interfere with the entity cache). For performance reasons, information for
 * all available redirects should be loaded in a single query where possible.
 *
 * The $types parameter allows for your module to have an early return (for
 * efficiency) if your module only supports certain redirect types.
