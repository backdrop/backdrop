/**
 * Perform a single batch operation.
 *
 * Callback for batch_set().
 *
 * @param $MULTIPLE_PARAMS
 *   Additional parameters specific to the batch. These are specified in the
 *   array passed to batch_set().
 * @param $context
 *   The batch context array, passed by reference. This contains the following
 *   properties:
 *   - 'finished': A float number between 0 and 1 informing the processing
 *     engine of the completion level for the operation. 1 (or no value
 *     explicitly set) means the operation is finished: the operation will not
 *     be called again, and execution passes to the next operation or the
 *     callback_batch_finished() implementation. Any other value causes this
 *     operation to be called again; however it should be noted that the value
 *     set here does not persist between executions of this callback: each time
 *     it is set to 1 by default by the batch system.
 *   - 'sandbox': This may be used by operations to persist data between
 *     successive calls to the current operation. Any values set in
 *     $context['sandbox'] will be there the next time this function is called
 *     for the current operation. For example, an operation may wish to store a
 *     pointer in a file or an offset for a large query. The 'sandbox' array key
 *     is not initially set when this callback is first called, which makes it
 *     useful for determining whether it is the first call of the callback or
 *     not:
 *     @code
 *       if (empty($context['sandbox'])) {
 *         // Perform set-up steps here.
 *       }
 *     @endcode
 *     The values in the sandbox are stored and updated in the database between
 *     http requests until the batch finishes processing. This avoids problems
 *     if the user navigates away from the page before the batch finishes.
 *   - 'message': A text message displayed in the progress page.
 *   - 'results': The array of results gathered so far by the batch processing.
 *     This array is highly useful for passing data between operations. After
 *     all operations have finished, this is passed to callback_batch_finished()
 *     where results may be referenced to display information to the end-user,
 *     such as how many total items were processed.
