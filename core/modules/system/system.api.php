 * $module.$group.inc. If the hook is located in $module.$group.inc, then that
 * file will be automatically loaded when needed.

/**
 * Define menu items and page callbacks.
 *
 * This hook enables modules to register paths in order to define how URL
 * requests are handled. Paths may be registered for URL handling only, or they
 * can register a link to be placed in a menu (usually the Navigation menu). A
 * path and its associated information is commonly called a "menu router item".
 * This hook is rarely called (for example, when modules are enabled), and
 * its results are cached in the database.
 *
 * hook_menu() implementations return an associative array whose keys define
 * paths and whose values are an associative array of properties for each
 * path. (The complete list of properties is in the return value section below.)
 *
 * @section sec_callback_funcs Callback Functions
 * The definition for each path may include a page callback function, which is
 * invoked when the registered path is requested. If there is no other
 * registered path that fits the requested path better, any further path
 * components are passed to the callback function. For example, your module
 * could register path 'abc/def':
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_menu() {
 *     $items['abc/def'] = array(
 *       'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_view',
 *     );
 *     return $items;
 *   }
 *
 *   function mymodule_abc_view($ghi = 0, $jkl = '') {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * When path 'abc/def' is requested, no further path components are in the
 * request, and no additional arguments are passed to the callback function (so
 * $ghi and $jkl would take the default values as defined in the function
 * signature). When 'abc/def/123/foo' is requested, $ghi will be '123' and
 * $jkl will be 'foo'. Note that this automatic passing of optional path
 * arguments applies only to page and theme callback functions.
 *
 * @subsection sub_callback_arguments Callback Arguments
 * In addition to optional path arguments, the page callback and other callback
 * functions may specify argument lists as arrays. These argument lists may
 * contain both fixed/hard-coded argument values and integers that correspond
 * to path components. When integers are used and the callback function is
 * called, the corresponding path components will be substituted for the
 * integers. That is, the integer 0 in an argument list will be replaced with
 * the first path component, integer 1 with the second, and so on (path
 * components are numbered starting from zero). To pass an integer without it
 * being replaced with its respective path component, use the string value of
 * the integer (e.g., '1') as the argument value. This substitution feature
 * allows you to re-use a callback function for several different paths. For
 * example:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_menu() {
 *     $items['abc/def'] = array(
 *       'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_view',
 *       'page arguments' => array(1, 'foo'),
 *     );
 *     return $items;
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * When path 'abc/def' is requested, the page callback function will get 'def'
 * as the first argument and (always) 'foo' as the second argument.
 *
 * If a page callback function uses an argument list array, and its path is
 * requested with optional path arguments, then the list array's arguments are
 * passed to the callback function first, followed by the optional path
 * arguments. Using the above example, when path 'abc/def/bar/baz' is requested,
 * mymodule_abc_view() will be called with 'def', 'foo', 'bar' and 'baz' as
 * arguments, in that order.
 *
 * Special care should be taken for the page callback drupal_get_form(), because
 * your specific form callback function will always receive $form and
 * &$form_state as the first function arguments:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_abc_form($form, &$form_state) {
 *     // ...
 *     return $form;
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * See @link form_api Form API documentation @endlink for details.
 *
 * @section sec_path_wildcards Wildcards in Paths
 * @subsection sub_simple_wildcards Simple Wildcards
 * Wildcards within paths also work with integer substitution. For example,
 * your module could register path 'my-module/%/edit':
 * @code
 *   $items['my-module/%/edit'] = array(
 *     'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_edit',
 *     'page arguments' => array(1),
 *   );
 * @endcode
 * When path 'my-module/foo/edit' is requested, integer 1 will be replaced
 * with 'foo' and passed to the callback function. Note that wildcards may not
 * be used as the first component.
 *
 * @subsection sub_autoload_wildcards Auto-Loader Wildcards
 * Registered paths may also contain special "auto-loader" wildcard components
 * in the form of '%mymodule_abc', where the '%' part means that this path
 * component is a wildcard, and the 'mymodule_abc' part defines the prefix for a
 * load function, which here would be named mymodule_abc_load(). When a matching
 * path is requested, your load function will receive as its first argument the
 * path component in the position of the wildcard; load functions may also be
 * passed additional arguments (see "load arguments" in the return value
 * section below). For example, your module could register path
 * 'my-module/%mymodule_abc/edit':
 * @code
 *   $items['my-module/%mymodule_abc/edit'] = array(
 *     'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_edit',
 *     'page arguments' => array(1),
 *   );
 * @endcode
 * When path 'my-module/123/edit' is requested, your load function
 * mymodule_abc_load() will be invoked with the argument '123', and should
 * load and return an "abc" object with internal id 123:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_abc_load($abc_id) {
 *     return db_query("SELECT * FROM {mymodule_abc} WHERE abc_id = :abc_id", array(':abc_id' => $abc_id))->fetchObject();
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * This 'abc' object will then be passed into the callback functions defined
 * for the menu item, such as the page callback function mymodule_abc_edit()
 * to replace the integer 1 in the argument array. Note that a load function
 * should return FALSE when it is unable to provide a loadable object. For
 * example, the node_load() function for the 'node/%node/edit' menu item will
 * return FALSE for the path 'node/999/edit' if a node with a node ID of 999
 * does not exist. The menu routing system will return a 404 error in this case.
 *
 * @subsection sub_argument_wildcards Argument Wildcards
 * You can also define a %wildcard_to_arg() function (for the example menu
 * entry above this would be 'mymodule_abc_to_arg()'). The _to_arg() function
 * is invoked to retrieve a value that is used in the path in place of the
 * wildcard. A good example is user.module, which defines
 * user_uid_optional_to_arg() (corresponding to the menu entry
 * 'tracker/%user_uid_optional'). This function returns the user ID of the
 * current user.
 *
 * The _to_arg() function will get called with three arguments:
 * - $arg: A string representing whatever argument may have been supplied by
 *   the caller (this is particularly useful if you want the _to_arg()
 *   function only supply a (default) value if no other value is specified,
 *   as in the case of user_uid_optional_to_arg().
 * - $map: An array of all path fragments (e.g. array('node','123','edit') for
 *   'node/123/edit').
 * - $index: An integer indicating which element of $map corresponds to $arg.
 *
 * _load() and _to_arg() functions may seem similar at first glance, but they
 * have different purposes and are called at different times. _load()
 * functions are called when the menu system is collecting arguments to pass
 * to the callback functions defined for the menu item. _to_arg() functions
 * are called when the menu system is generating links to related paths, such
 * as the tabs for a set of MENU_LOCAL_TASK items.
 *
 * @section sec_render_tabs Rendering Menu Items As Tabs
 * You can also make groups of menu items to be rendered (by default) as tabs
 * on a page. To do that, first create one menu item of type MENU_NORMAL_ITEM,
 * with your chosen path, such as 'foo'. Then duplicate that menu item, using a
 * subdirectory path, such as 'foo/tab1', and changing the type to
 * MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK to make it the default tab for the group. Then add
 * the additional tab items, with paths such as "foo/tab2" etc., with type
 * MENU_LOCAL_TASK. Example:
 * @code
 * // Make "Foo settings" appear on the admin Config page
 * $items['admin/config/system/foo'] = array(
 *   'title' => 'Foo settings',
 *   'type' => MENU_NORMAL_ITEM,
 *   // Page callback, etc. need to be added here.
 * );
 * // Make "Tab 1" the main tab on the "Foo settings" page
 * $items['admin/config/system/foo/tab1'] = array(
 *   'title' => 'Tab 1',

 * @return
 *   An array of menu items. Each menu item has a key corresponding to the
 *   Drupal path being registered. The corresponding array value is an
 *   associative array that may contain the following key-value pairs:
 *   - "title": Required. The untranslated title of the menu item.
 *   - "title callback": Function to generate the title; defaults to t().
 *     If you require only the raw string to be output, set this to FALSE.
 *   - "title arguments": Arguments to send to t() or your custom callback,
 *     with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "description": The untranslated description of the menu item.
 *   - "page callback": The function to call to display a web page when the user
 *     visits the path. If omitted, the parent menu item's callback will be used
 *     instead.
 *   - "page arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the page callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "delivery callback": The function to call to package the result of the
 *     page callback function and send it to the browser. Defaults to
 *     drupal_deliver_html_page() unless a value is inherited from a parent menu
 *     item. Note that this function is called even if the access checks fail,
 *     so any custom delivery callback function should take that into account.
 *     See drupal_deliver_html_page() for an example.
 *   - "access callback": A function returning TRUE if the user has access
 *     rights to this menu item, and FALSE if not. It can also be a boolean
 *     constant instead of a function, and you can also use numeric values
 *     (will be cast to boolean). Defaults to user_access() unless a value is
 *     inherited from the parent menu item; only MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK items
 *     can inherit access callbacks. To use the user_access() default callback,
 *     you must specify the permission to check as 'access arguments' (see
 *     below).
 *   - "access arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the access callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above. If the
 *     access callback is inherited (see above), the access arguments will be
 *     inherited with it, unless overridden in the child menu item.
 *   - "theme callback": (optional) A function returning the machine-readable
 *     name of the theme that will be used to render the page. If not provided,
 *     the value will be inherited from a parent menu item. If there is no
 *     theme callback, or if the function does not return the name of a current
 *     active theme on the site, the theme for this page will be determined by
 *     either hook_custom_theme() or the default theme instead. As a general
 *     rule, the use of theme callback functions should be limited to pages
 *     whose functionality is very closely tied to a particular theme, since
 *     they can only be overridden by modules which specifically target those
 *     pages in hook_menu_alter(). Modules implementing more generic theme
 *     switching functionality (for example, a module which allows the theme to
 *     be set dynamically based on the current user's role) should use
 *     hook_custom_theme() instead.
 *   - "theme arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the theme callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "file": A file that will be included before the page callback is called;
 *     this allows page callback functions to be in separate files. The file
 *     should be relative to the implementing module's directory unless
 *     otherwise specified by the "file path" option. Does not apply to other
 *     callbacks (only page callback).
 *   - "file path": The path to the directory containing the file specified in
 *     "file". This defaults to the path to the module implementing the hook.
 *   - "load arguments": An array of arguments to be passed to each of the
 *     wildcard object loaders in the path, after the path argument itself.
 *     For example, if a module registers path node/%node/revisions/%/view
 *     with load arguments set to array(3), the '%node' in the path indicates
 *     that the loader function node_load() will be called with the second
 *     path component as the first argument. The 3 in the load arguments
 *     indicates that the fourth path component will also be passed to
 *     node_load() (numbering of path components starts at zero). So, if path
 *     node/12/revisions/29/view is requested, node_load(12, 29) will be called.
 *     There are also two "magic" values that can be used in load arguments.
 *     "%index" indicates the index of the wildcard path component. "%map"
 *     indicates the path components as an array. For example, if a module
 *     registers for several paths of the form 'user/%user_category/edit/*', all
 *     of them can use the same load function user_category_load(), by setting
 *     the load arguments to array('%map', '%index'). For instance, if the user
 *     is editing category 'foo' by requesting path 'user/32/edit/foo', the load
 *     function user_category_load() will be called with 32 as its first
 *     argument, the array ('user', 32, 'edit', 'foo') as the map argument,
 *     and 1 as the index argument (because %user_category is the second path
 *     component and numbering starts at zero). user_category_load() can then
 *     use these values to extract the information that 'foo' is the category
 *     being requested.
 *   - "weight": An integer that determines the relative position of items in
 *     the menu; higher-weighted items sink. Defaults to 0. Menu items with the
 *     same weight are ordered alphabetically.
 *   - "menu_name": Optional. Set this to a custom menu if you don't want your
 *     item to be placed in Navigation.
 *   - "expanded": Optional. If set to TRUE, and if a menu link is provided for
 *     this menu item (as a result of other properties), then the menu link is
 *     always expanded, equivalent to its 'always expanded' checkbox being set
 *     in the UI.
 *   - "context": (optional) Defines the context a tab may appear in. By
 *     default, all tabs are only displayed as local tasks when being rendered
 *     in a page context. All tabs that should be accessible as contextual links
 *     in page region containers outside of the parent menu item's primary page
 *     context should be registered using one of the following contexts:
 *     - MENU_CONTEXT_PAGE: (default) The tab is displayed as local task for the
 *       page context only.
 *     - MENU_CONTEXT_INLINE: The tab is displayed as contextual link outside of
 *       the primary page context only.
 *     Contexts can be combined. For example, to display a tab both on a page
 *     and inline, a menu router item may specify:
 *     @code
 *       'context' => MENU_CONTEXT_PAGE | MENU_CONTEXT_INLINE,
 *     @endcode
 *   - "tab_parent": For local task menu items, the path of the task's parent
 *     item; defaults to the same path without the last component (e.g., the
 *     default parent for 'admin/people/create' is 'admin/people').
 *   - "tab_root": For local task menu items, the path of the closest non-tab
 *     item; same default as "tab_parent".
 *   - "position": Position of the block ('left' or 'right') on the system
 *     administration page for this item.
 *   - "type": A bitmask of flags describing properties of the menu item.
 *     Many shortcut bitmasks are provided as constants in menu.inc:
 *     - MENU_NORMAL_ITEM: Normal menu items show up in the menu tree and can be
 *       moved/hidden by the administrator.
 *     - MENU_CALLBACK: Callbacks simply register a path so that the correct
 *       information is generated when the path is accessed.
 *     - MENU_SUGGESTED_ITEM: Modules may "suggest" menu items that the
 *       administrator may enable.
 *     - MENU_LOCAL_ACTION: Local actions are menu items that describe actions
 *       on the parent item such as adding a new user or block, and are
 *       rendered in the action-links list in your theme.
 *     - MENU_LOCAL_TASK: Local tasks are menu items that describe different
 *       displays of data, and are generally rendered as tabs.
 *     - MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK: Every set of local tasks should provide one
 *       "default" task, which should display the same page as the parent item.
 *     If the "type" element is omitted, MENU_NORMAL_ITEM is assumed.
 *   - "options": An array of options to be passed to l() when generating a link
 *     from this menu item. Note that the "options" parameter has no effect on
 *     MENU_LOCAL_TASK, MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK, and MENU_LOCAL_ACTION items.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see page_example.module.
 * For comprehensive documentation on the menu system, see
 * http://drupal.org/node/102338.

 * one exists) check the $form_state. The base form ID is stored under
 * $form_state['build_info']['base_form_id'].
 *
 * See hook_forms() for more information on how to implement base forms in
 * Drupal.

/**
 * Map form_ids to form builder functions.
 *
 * By default, when drupal_get_form() is called, the system will look for a
 * function with the same name as the form ID, and use that function to build
 * the form. If no such function is found, Drupal calls this hook. Modules
 * implementing this hook can then provide their own instructions for mapping
 * form IDs to constructor functions. As a result, you can easily map multiple
 * form IDs to a single form constructor (referred to as a 'base' form).
 *
 * Using a base form can help to avoid code duplication, by allowing many
 * similar forms to use the same code base. Another benefit is that it becomes
 * much easier for other modules to apply a general change to the group of
 * forms; hook_form_BASE_FORM_ID_alter() can be used to easily alter multiple
 * forms at once by directly targeting the shared base form.
 *
 * Two example use cases where base forms may be useful are given below.
 *
 * First, you can use this hook to tell the form system to use a different
 * function to build certain forms in your module; this is often used to define
 * a form "factory" function that is used to build several similar forms. In
 * this case, your hook implementation will likely ignore all of the input
 * arguments. See node_forms() for an example of this. Note, node_forms() is the
 * hook_forms() implementation; the base form itself is defined in node_form().
 *
 * Second, you could use this hook to define how to build a form with a
 * dynamically-generated form ID. In this case, you would need to verify that
 * the $form_id input matched your module's format for dynamically-generated
 * form IDs, and if so, act appropriately.
 *
 * @param $form_id
 *   The unique string identifying the desired form.
 * @param $args
 *   An array containing the original arguments provided to drupal_get_form()
 *   or drupal_form_submit(). These are always passed to the form builder and
 *   do not have to be specified manually in 'callback arguments'.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array whose keys define form_ids and whose values are an
 *   associative array defining the following keys:
 *   - callback: The name of the form builder function to invoke. This will be
 *     used for the base form ID, for example, to target a base form using
 *     hook_form_BASE_FORM_ID_alter().
 *   - callback arguments: (optional) Additional arguments to pass to the
 *     function defined in 'callback', which are prepended to $args.
 *   - wrapper_callback: (optional) The name of a form builder function to
 *     invoke before the form builder defined in 'callback' is invoked. This
 *     wrapper callback may prepopulate the $form array with form elements,
 *     which will then be already contained in the $form that is passed on to
 *     the form builder defined in 'callback'. For example, a wrapper callback
 *     could setup wizard-alike form buttons that are the same for a variety of
 *     forms that belong to the wizard, which all share the same wrapper
 *     callback.

 *   An array of existing implementations that may be used for override
 *   purposes. This is primarily useful for themes that may wish to examine
 *   existing implementations to extract data (such as arguments) so that
 *   it may properly register its own, higher priority implementations.
 * @param $type
 *   Whether a theme, module, etc. is being processed. This is primarily useful
 *   so that themes tell if they are the actual theme being called or a parent
 *   theme. May be one of:
 *   - 'module': A module is being checked for theme implementations.
 *   - 'base_theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for a theme that is
 *     a parent of the actual theme being used.
 *   - 'theme_engine': A theme engine is being checked for the actual theme
 *     being used.
 *   - 'base_theme': A base theme is being checked for theme implementations.
 *   - 'theme': The actual theme in use is being checked.
 * @param $theme
 *   The actual name of theme, module, etc. that is being being processed.
 * @param $path
 *   The directory path of the theme or module, so that it doesn't need to be
 *   looked up.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An associative array of theme hook information. The keys on the outer
 *   array are the internal names of the hooks, and the values are arrays
 *   containing information about the hook. Each information array must contain
 *   either a 'variables' element or a 'render element' element, but not both.
 *   Use 'render element' if you are theming a single element or element tree
 *   composed of elements, such as a form array, a page array, or a single
 *   checkbox element. Use 'variables' if your theme implementation is
 *   intended to be called directly through theme() and has multiple arguments
 *   for the data and style; in this case, the variables not supplied by the
 *   calling function will be given default values and passed to the template
 *   or theme function. The returned theme information array can contain the
 *   following key/value pairs:
 *   - variables: (see above) Each array key is the name of the variable, and
 *     the value given is used as the default value if the function calling
 *     theme() does not supply it. Template implementations receive each array
 *     key as a variable in the template file (so they must be legal PHP
 *     variable names). Function implementations are passed the variables in a
 *     single $variables function argument.
 *   - render element: (see above) The name of the renderable element or element
 *     tree to pass to the theme function. This name is used as the name of the
 *     variable that holds the renderable element or tree in preprocess and
 *     process functions.
 *   - file: The file the implementation resides in. This file will be included
 *     prior to the theme being rendered, to make sure that the function or
 *     preprocess function (as needed) is actually loaded; this makes it
 *     possible to split theme functions out into separate files quite easily.
 *   - path: Override the path of the file to be used. Ordinarily the module or
 *     theme path will be used, but if the file will not be in the default
 *     path, include it here. This path should be relative to the Drupal root
 *     directory.
 *   - template: If specified, this theme implementation is a template, and
 *     this is the template file without an extension. Do not put .tpl.php on
 *     this file; that extension will be added automatically by the default
 *     rendering engine (which is PHPTemplate). If 'path', above, is specified,
 *     the template should also be in this path.
 *   - function: If specified, this will be the function name to invoke for
 *     this implementation. If neither 'template' nor 'function' is specified,
 *     a default function name will be assumed. For example, if a module
 *     registers the 'node' theme hook, 'theme_node' will be assigned to its
 *     function. If the chameleon theme registers the node hook, it will be
 *     assigned 'chameleon_node' as its function.
 *   - base hook: A string declaring the base theme hook if this theme
 *     implementation is actually implementing a suggestion for another theme
 *     hook.
 *   - pattern: A regular expression pattern to be used to allow this theme
 *     implementation to have a dynamic name. The convention is to use __ to
 *     differentiate the dynamic portion of the theme. For example, to allow
 *     users to be themed by role, the pattern might be: 'user__'. Then,
 *     when the user is themed, call:
 *     @code
 *     theme(array('user__' . $rid, 'user'), $user)
 *     @endcode
 *   - preprocess functions: A list of functions used to preprocess this data.
 *     Ordinarily this won't be used; it's automatically filled in. By default,
 *     for a module this will be filled in as template_preprocess_HOOK. For
 *     a theme this will be filled in as phptemplate_preprocess and
 *     phptemplate_preprocess_HOOK as well as themename_preprocess and
 *     themename_preprocess_HOOK.
 *   - override preprocess functions: Set to TRUE when a theme does NOT want
 *     the standard preprocess functions to run. This can be used to give a
 *     theme FULL control over how variables are set. For example, if a theme
 *     wants total control over how certain variables in the page.tpl.php are
 *     set, this can be set to true. Please keep in mind that when this is used
 *     by a theme, that theme becomes responsible for making sure necessary
 *     variables are set.
 *   - type: (automatically derived) Where the theme hook is defined:
 *     'module', 'theme_engine', or 'theme'.
 *   - theme path: (automatically derived) The directory path of the theme or
 *     module, so that it doesn't need to be looked up.

 * - Checking update requirements ($phase == 'update').
 * - Status reporting ($phase == 'runtime').
 *
 * Note that this hook, like all others dealing with installation and updates,
 * must reside in a module_name.install file, or it will not properly abort
 * the installation of the module if a critical requirement is missing.
 *
 * During the 'install' phase, modules can for example assert that
 * library or server versions are available or sufficient.
 * Note that the installation of a module can happen during installation of
 * Drupal itself (by install.php) with an installation profile or later by hand.
 * As a consequence, install-time requirements must be checked without access
 * to the full Drupal API, because it is not available during install.php.
 * For localization you should for example use $t = get_t() to
 * retrieve the appropriate localization function name (t() or st()).
 * If a requirement has a severity of REQUIREMENT_ERROR, install.php will abort
 * or at least the module will not install.
 * Other severity levels have no effect on the installation.
 * Module dependencies do not belong to these installation requirements,
 * but should be defined in the module's .info file.
 *
 * The 'runtime' phase is not limited to pure installation requirements
 * but can also be used for more general status information like maintenance
 * tasks and security issues.
 * The returned 'requirements' will be listed on the status report in the
 * administration section, with indication of the severity level.
 * Moreover, any requirement with a severity of REQUIREMENT_ERROR severity will
 * result in a notice on the administration configuration page.
 *
 * @param $phase
 *   The phase in which requirements are checked:
 *   - install: The module is being installed.
 *   - update: The module is enabled and update.php is run.
 *   - runtime: The runtime requirements are being checked and shown on the
 *     status report page.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array where the keys are arbitrary but must be unique (it
 *   is suggested to use the module short name as a prefix) and the values are
 *   themselves associative arrays with the following elements:
 *   - title: The name of the requirement.
 *   - value: The current value (e.g., version, time, level, etc). During
 *     install phase, this should only be used for version numbers, do not set
 *     it if not applicable.
 *   - description: The description of the requirement/status.
 *   - severity: The requirement's result/severity level, one of:
 *     - REQUIREMENT_INFO: For info only.
 *     - REQUIREMENT_OK: The requirement is satisfied.
 *     - REQUIREMENT_WARNING: The requirement failed with a warning.

/**
 * Perform a single update.
 *
 * For each change that requires one or more actions to be performed when
 * updating a site, add a new hook_update_N(), which will be called by
 * update.php. The documentation block preceding this function is stripped of
 * newlines and used as the description for the update on the pending updates
 * task list. Schema updates should adhere to the
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/150215 Schema API. @endlink
 *
 * Implementations of hook_update_N() are named (module name)_update_(number).
 * The numbers are composed of three parts:
 * - 1 digit for Drupal core compatibility.
 * - 1 digit for your module's major release version (e.g., is this the 7.x-1.*
 *   (1) or 7.x-2.* (2) series of your module?). This digit should be 0 for
 *   initial porting of your module to a new Drupal core API.
 * - 2 digits for sequential counting, starting with 00.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - mymodule_update_7000(): This is the required update for mymodule to run
 *   with Drupal core API 7.x when upgrading from Drupal core API 6.x.
 * - mymodule_update_7100(): This is the first update to get the database ready
 *   to run mymodule 7.x-1.*.
 * - mymodule_update_7200(): This is the first update to get the database ready
 *   to run mymodule 7.x-2.*. Users can directly update from 6.x-2.* to 7.x-2.*
 *   and they get all 70xx and 72xx updates, but not 71xx updates, because
 *   those reside in the 7.x-1.x branch only.
 *
 * A good rule of thumb is to remove updates older than two major releases of
 * Drupal. See hook_update_last_removed() to notify Drupal about the removals.
 * For further information about releases and release numbers see:
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/711070 Maintaining a drupal.org project with Git @endlink
 *
 * Never renumber update functions.
 *
 * Implementations of this hook should be placed in a mymodule.install file in
 * the same directory as mymodule.module. Drupal core's updates are implemented
 * using the system module as a name and stored in database/updates.inc.
 *
 * Not all module functions are available from within a hook_update_N() function.
 * In order to call a function from your mymodule.module or an include file,
 * you need to explicitly load that file first.
 *
 * During database updates the schema of any module could be out of date. For
 * this reason, caution is needed when using any API function within an update
 * function - particularly CRUD functions, functions that depend on the schema
 * (for example by using drupal_write_record()), and any functions that invoke
 * hooks. See @link update_api Update versions of API functions @endlink for
 * details.
 *
 * If your update task is potentially time-consuming, you'll need to implement a
 * multipass update to avoid PHP timeouts. Multipass updates use the $sandbox
 * parameter provided by the batch API (normally, $context['sandbox']) to store
 * information between successive calls, and the $sandbox['#finished'] value
 * to provide feedback regarding completion level.
 *
 * See the batch operations page for more information on how to use the
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/180528 Batch API. @endlink
 *
 * @param $sandbox
 *   Stores information for multipass updates. See above for more information.
 *
 * @throws DrupalUpdateException, PDOException
 *   In case of error, update hooks should throw an instance of DrupalUpdateException
 *   with a meaningful message for the user. If a database query fails for whatever
 *   reason, it will throw a PDOException.
 *
 * @return
 *   Optionally, update hooks may return a translated string that will be
 *   displayed to the user after the update has completed. If no message is
 *   returned, no message will be presented to the user.

 * finished the site configuration step but before it has moved on to the
 * final import of languages and the end of the installation. You can have any
 * number of custom tasks to perform during this phase.
 *
 * Each task you define here corresponds to a callback function which you must
 * separately define and which is called when your task is run. This function
 * will receive the global installation state variable, $install_state, as
 * input, and has the opportunity to access or modify any of its settings. See
 * the install_state_defaults() function in the installer for the list of
 * $install_state settings used by Drupal core.
 *
 * At the end of your task function, you can indicate that you want the
 * installer to pause and display a page to the user by returning any themed
 * output that should be displayed on that page (but see below for tasks that
 * use the form API or batch API; the return values of these task functions are
 * handled differently). You should also use drupal_set_title() within the task
 * callback function to set a custom page title. For some tasks, however, you
 * may want to simply do some processing and pass control to the next task
 * without ending the page request; to indicate this, simply do not send back
 * a return value from your task function at all. This can be used, for
 * example, by installation profiles that need to configure certain site
 * settings in the database without obtaining any input from the user.
 *
 * The task function is treated specially if it defines a form or requires
 * batch processing; in that case, you should return either the form API
 * definition or batch API array, as appropriate. See below for more
 * information on the 'type' key that you must define in the task definition
 * to inform the installer that your task falls into one of those two
 * categories. It is important to use these APIs directly, since the installer
 * may be run non-interactively (for example, via a command line script), all
 * in one page request; in that case, the installer will automatically take
 * care of submitting forms and processing batches correctly for both types of
 * installations. You can inspect the $install_state['interactive'] boolean to
 * see whether or not the current installation is interactive, if you need
 * access to this information.
 *
 * Remember that a user installing Drupal interactively will be able to reload
 * an installation page multiple times, so you should use variable_set() and
 * variable_get() if you are collecting any data that you need to store and
 * inspect later. It is important to remove any temporary variables using
 * variable_del() before your last task has completed and control is handed
 * back to the installer.
 * 
 * @param array $install_state
 *   An array of information about the current installation state.
 *

 *   A keyed array of tasks the profile will perform during the final stage of

 *   containing the following key-value pairs (all of which are optional):
 *   - display_name: The human-readable name of the task. This will be
 *     displayed to the user while the installer is running, along with a list
 *     of other tasks that are being run. Leave this unset to prevent the task
 *     from appearing in the list.
 *   - display: This is a boolean which can be used to provide finer-grained
 *     control over whether or not the task will display. This is mostly useful
 *     for tasks that are intended to display only under certain conditions;
 *     for these tasks, you can set 'display_name' to the name that you want to
 *     display, but then use this boolean to hide the task only when certain
 *     conditions apply.
 *   - type: A string representing the type of task. This parameter has three
 *     possible values:
 *     - normal: (default) This indicates that the task will be treated as a
 *       regular callback function, which does its processing and optionally
 *       returns HTML output.
 *     - batch: This indicates that the task function will return a batch API
 *       definition suitable for batch_set(). The installer will then take care
 *       of automatically running the task via batch processing.
 *     - form: This indicates that the task function will return a standard
 *       form API definition (and separately define validation and submit
 *       handlers, as appropriate). The installer will then take care of
 *       automatically directing the user through the form submission process.
 *   - run: A constant representing the manner in which the task will be run.
 *     This parameter has three possible values:
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_RUN_IF_NOT_COMPLETED: (default) This indicates that the
 *       task will run once during the installation of the profile.
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_SKIP: This indicates that the task will not run during
 *       the current installation page request. It can be used to skip running
 *       an installation task when certain conditions are met, even though the
 *       task may still show on the list of installation tasks presented to the
 *       user.
 *     - INSTALL_TASK_RUN_IF_REACHED: This indicates that the task will run on
 *       each installation page request that reaches it. This is rarely
 *       necessary for an installation profile to use; it is primarily used by
 *       the Drupal installer for bootstrap-related tasks.
 *   - function: Normally this does not need to be set, but it can be used to
 *     force the installer to call a different function when the task is run
 *     (rather than the function whose name is given by the array key). This
 *     could be used, for example, to allow the same function to be called by
 *     two different tasks.

/**
 * Provide information about available placeholder tokens and token types.
 *
 * Tokens are placeholders that can be put into text by using the syntax
 * [type:token], where type is the machine-readable name of a token type, and
 * token is the machine-readable name of a token within this group. This hook
 * provides a list of types and tokens to be displayed on text editing screens,
 * so that people editing text can see what their token options are.
 *
 * The actual token replacement is done by token_replace(), which invokes
 * hook_tokens(). Your module will need to implement that hook in order to
 * generate token replacements from the tokens defined here.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array of available tokens and token types. The outer array
 *   has two components:
 *   - types: An associative array of token types (groups). Each token type is
 *     an associative array with the following components:
 *     - name: The translated human-readable short name of the token type.
 *     - description: A translated longer description of the token type.
 *     - needs-data: The type of data that must be provided to token_replace()
 *       in the $data argument (i.e., the key name in $data) in order for tokens
 *       of this type to be used in the $text being processed. For instance, if
 *       the token needs a node object, 'needs-data' should be 'node', and to
 *       use this token in token_replace(), the caller needs to supply a node
 *       object as $data['node']. Some token data can also be supplied
 *       indirectly; for instance, a node object in $data supplies a user object
 *       (the author of the node), allowing user tokens to be used when only
 *       a node data object is supplied.
 *   - tokens: An associative array of tokens. The outer array is keyed by the
 *     group name (the same key as in the types array). Within each group of
 *     tokens, each token item is keyed by the machine name of the token, and
 *     each token item has the following components:
 *     - name: The translated human-readable short name of the token.
 *     - description: A translated longer description of the token.
 *     - type (optional): A 'needs-data' data type supplied by this token, which
 *       should match a 'needs-data' value from another token type. For example,
 *       the node author token provides a user object, which can then be used
 *       for token replacement data in token_replace() without having to supply
 *       a separate user object.

/**
 * @defgroup update_api Update versions of API functions
 * @{
 * Functions that are similar to normal API functions, but do not invoke hooks.
 *
 * These simplified versions of core API functions are provided for use by
 * update functions (hook_update_N() implementations).
 *
 * During database updates the schema of any module could be out of date. For
 * this reason, caution is needed when using any API function within an update
 * function - particularly CRUD functions, functions that depend on the schema
 * (for example by using drupal_write_record()), and any functions that invoke
 * hooks.
 *
 * Instead, a simplified utility function should be used. If a utility version
 * of the API function you require does not already exist, then you should
 * create a new function. The new utility function should be named
 * _update_N_mymodule_my_function(). N is the schema version the function acts
 * on (the schema version is the number N from the hook_update_N()
 * implementation where this schema was introduced, or a number following the
 * same numbering scheme), and mymodule_my_function is the name of the original
 * API function including the module's name.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - _update_6000_mymodule_save(): This function performs a save operation
 *   without invoking any hooks using the 6.x schema.
 * - _update_7000_mymodule_save(): This function performs the same save
 *   operation using the 7.x schema.
 *
 * The utility function should not invoke any hooks, and should perform database
 * operations using functions from the
 * @link database Database abstraction layer, @endlink
 * like db_insert(), db_update(), db_delete(), db_query(), and so on.
 *
 * If a change to the schema necessitates a change to the utility function, a
 * new function should be created with a name based on the version of the schema
 * it acts on. See _update_7000_bar_get_types() and _update_7001_bar_get_types()
 * in the code examples that follow.
 *
 * For example, foo.install could contain:
 * @code
 * function foo_update_dependencies() {
 *   // foo_update_7010() needs to run after bar_update_7000().
 *   $dependencies['foo'][7010] = array(
 *     'bar' => 7000,
 *   );
 *
 *   // foo_update_7036() needs to run after bar_update_7001().
 *   $dependencies['foo'][7036] = array(
 *     'bar' => 7001,
 *   );
 *
 *   return $dependencies;
 * }
 *
 * function foo_update_7000() {
 *   // No updates have been run on the {bar_types} table yet, so this needs
 *   // to work with the 6.x schema.
 *   foreach (_update_6000_bar_get_types() as $type) {
 *     // Rename a variable.
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * function foo_update_7010() {
 *    // Since foo_update_7010() is going to run after bar_update_7000(), it
 *    // needs to operate on the new schema, not the old one.
 *    foreach (_update_7000_bar_get_types() as $type) {
 *      // Rename a different variable.
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * function foo_update_7036() {
 *   // This update will run after bar_update_7001().
 *   foreach (_update_7001_bar_get_types() as $type) {
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * And bar.install could contain:
 * @code
 * function bar_update_7000() {
 *   // Type and bundle are confusing, so we renamed the table.
 *   db_rename_table('bar_types', 'bar_bundles');
 * }
 *
 * function bar_update_7001() {
 *   // Database table names should be singular when possible.
 *   db_rename_table('bar_bundles', 'bar_bundle');
 * }
 *
 * function _update_6000_bar_get_types() {
 *   db_query('SELECT * FROM {bar_types}')->fetchAll();
 * }
 *
 * function _update_7000_bar_get_types() {
