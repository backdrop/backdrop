/**
 * @defgroup views_handlers About Views handlers
 * @{
 * In Views, a handler is an object that is part of the view and is part of the
 * query building flow.
 *
 * Handlers are objects; much of the time, the base handlers will work, but
 * often you'll need to override the handler to achieve something meaningful.
 * One typical handler override will be views_handler_filter_operator_in which
 * allows you to have a filter select from a list of options; you'll need to
 * override this to provide your list.
 *
 * Handlers have two distinct code flows; the UI flow and the view building
 * flow.
 *
 * For the query flow:
 * - handler->construct()
 *   - Create the initial handler; at this time it is not yet attached to a
 *     view. It is here that you can set basic defaults if needed, but there
 *     will be no knowledge of the environment yet.
 * - handler->set_definition()
 *   - Set the data from hook_views_data() relevant to the handler.
 * - handler->init()
 *   - Attach the handler to a view, and usually provides the options from the
 *     display.
 * - handler->pre_query()
 *   - Run prior to the query() stage to do early processing.
 * - handler->query()
 *   - Do the bulk of the work this handler needs to do to add itself to the
 *     query.
 *
 * Fields, being the only handlers concerned with output, also have an extended
 * piece of the flow:
 *
 * - handler->pre_render(&$values)
 *   - Called prior to the actual rendering, this allows handlers to query for
 *     extra data; the entire resultset is available here, and this is where
 *     items that have "multiple values" per record can do their extra query for
 *     all of the records available. There are several examples of this at work
 *     in the code, see for example views_handler_field_user_roles.
 * - handler->render()
 *   - This does the actual work of rendering the field.
 *
 * Most handlers are just extensions of existing classes with a few tweaks that
 * are specific to the field in question. For example,
 * views_handler_filter_in_operator provides a simple mechanism to set a
 * multiple-value list for setting filter values. Below,
 * views_handler_filter_node_type overrides the list options, but inherits
 * everything else.
 *
 * @code
 * class views_handler_filter_node_type extends views_handler_filter_in_operator {
 *   function get_value_options() {
 *     if (!isset($this->value_options)) {
 *       $this->value_title = t('Node type');
 *       $types = node_get_types();
 *       foreach ($types as $type => $info) {
 *         $options[$type] = $info-&gt;name;
 *       }
 *       $this->value_options = $options;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Handlers are stored in their own files and loaded on demand. Like all other
 * autoloaded files, they must first be registered via hook_autoload_info().
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * function example_autoload_info() {
 * return array(
 *   // Views handlers
 *   'example_handler_argument_string' => 'handlers/example_handler_argument_string.inc',
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * The best place to learn more about handlers and how they work is to explore
 * @link views_handlers Views' handlers @endlink and use existing handlers as a
 * guide and a model. Understanding how views_handler and its child classes work
 * is handy but you can do a lot just following these models. You can also
 * explore the views module directory, particularly node.views.inc.
 *
 * Please note that while all handler names in views are prefixed with views_,
 * you should use your own module's name to prefix your handler names in order
 * to ensure namespace safety. Note that the basic pattern for handler naming
 * goes like this:
 *
 * [module]_handler_[type]_[tablename]_[fieldname].
 *
 * Sometimes table and fieldname are not appropriate, but something that
 * resembles what the table/field would be can be used.

/**
 * @defgroup views_plugins About Views plugins
 *
 * In Views, a plugin is a bit like a handler, but plugins are not directly
 * responsible for building the query. Instead, they are objects that are used
 * to display the view or make other modifications.
 *
 * There are several types of plugins in Views:
 * - Display: Display plugins are responsible for controlling *where* a view
 *   lives; that is, how they are being exposed to other parts of Backdrop. Page
 *   and block are the most common displays, as well as the ubiquitous 'master'
 *   (or 'default') display.
 * - Style: Style plugins control how a view is displayed. For the most part
 *   they are object wrappers around theme templates. Styles could for example
 *   be HTML lists or tables.
 * - Row style: Row styles handle each individual record from the main view
 *   table. The two included by default render the entire entity (nodes only),
 *   or selected fields.
 * - Argument default: Argument default plugins allow pluggable ways of
 *   providing default values for contextual filters (previously 'arguments').
 *   This is useful for blocks and other display types lacking a natural
 *   argument input. Examples are plugins to extract node and user IDs from the
 *   URL.
 * - Argument validator: Validator plugins can ensure arguments are valid, and
 *   even do transformations on the arguments. They can also provide replacement
 *   patterns for the view title. For example, the 'content' validator
 *   verifies verifies that the argument value corresponds to a node, loads
 *   that node and provides the node title as a replacement pattern.
 * - Access: Access plugins are responsible for controlling access to the view.
 *   Views includes plugins for checking user roles and individual permissions.
 * - Query: Query plugins generate and execute a query, so they can be seen as
 *   a data backend. The default implementation is using SQL. There are
 *   contributed modules reading data from other sources, see for example the
 *   Views XML Backend module.
 * - Cache: Cache plugins control the storage and loading of caches. Currently
 *   they can do both result and render caching, but maybe one day cache the
 *   generated query.
 * - Pager plugins: Pager plugins take care of everything regarding pagers.
 *   From getting and setting the total amount of items to render the pager and
 *   setting the global pager arrays.
 * - Exposed form plugins: Exposed form plugins are responsible for building,
 *   rendering and controlling exposed forms. They can expose new parts of the
 *   view to the user and more.
 * - Display extenders: Display extender plugins allow scaling of views options
 *   horizontally. This means that you can add options and do stuff on all
 *   views displays. One theoretical example is metatags for views.
 *
 * Plugins are registered by implementing hook_views_plugins() in your
 * modulename.views.inc file and returning an array of data.
 * For examples please look at views_views_plugins() in
 * views/includes/plugins.inc as it has examples for all of them.
 *
 * Similar to handlers, make sure that you add your plugin files to the
 * module.info file.
 *
 * The array defining plugins will look something like this:
 * @code
 * return array(
 *   'display' => array(
 *     // ... list of display plugins,
 *    ),
 *   'style' => array(
 *     // ... list of style plugins,
 *    ),
 *   'row' => array(
 *     // ... list of row style plugins,
 *    ),
 *   'argument default' => array(
 *     // ... list of argument default plugins,
 *    ),
 *   'argument validator' => array(
 *     // ... list of argument validator plugins,
 *    ),
 *    'access' => array(
 *     // ... list of access plugins,
 *    ),
 *    'query' => array(
 *      // ... list of query plugins,
 *     ),
 *    'cache' => array(
 *      // ... list of cache plugins,
 *     ),
 *    'pager' => array(
 *      // ... list of pager plugins,
 *     ),
 *    'exposed_form' => array(
 *      // ... list of exposed_form plugins,
 *     ),
 *    'display_extender' => array(
 *      // ... list of display extender plugins,
 *     ),
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Each plugin will be registered with an identifier for the plugin, plus a
 * fairly lengthy list of items that can define how and where the plugin is
 * used. Here is an example of a row style plugin from Views core:
 * @code
 *     'node' => array(
 *       'title' => t('Node'),
 *       'help' => t('Display the node with standard node view.'),
 *       'handler' => 'views_plugin_row_node_view',
 *       'path' => backdrop_get_path('module', 'views') . '/modules/node', // not necessary for most modules
 *       'theme' => 'views_view_row_node',
 *       'base' => array('node'), // only works with 'node' as base.
 *       'uses options' => TRUE,
 *       'type' => 'normal',
 *     ),
 * @endcode
 *
 * Of particular interest is the *path* directive, which works a little
 * differently from handler registration; each plugin must define its own path,
 * rather than relying on a global info for the paths. For example:
 * @code
 *    'feed' => array(
 *      'title' => t('Feed'),
 *      'help' => t('Display the view as a feed, such as an RSS feed.'),
 *      'handler' => 'views_plugin_display_feed',
 *      'uses hook menu' => TRUE,
 *      'use ajax' => FALSE,
 *      'use pager' => FALSE,
 *      'accept attachments' => FALSE,
 *      'admin' => t('Feed'),
 *      'help topic' => 'display-feed',
 *     ),
 * @endcode
 *
 * Please be sure to prefix your plugin identifiers with your module name to
 * ensure namespace safety; after all, two different modules could try to
 * implement the 'grid2' plugin, and that would cause one plugin to completely
 * fail.
 *

 *   localization. The plugin name should be prefixed with your module name.
 *   The value for each entry is an associateive array that may contain the
 *   following entries:
 *   - Used by all plugin types:
 *     - title (required): The name of the plugin, as shown in Views. Wrap in
 *       t().
 *     - handler (required): The name of the file containing the class
 *       describing the handler, which must also be the name of the handler's
 *       class.
 *     - path: Path to the handler. Only required if the handler is not placed
 *       in the same folder as the .module file or in the subfolder 'views'.
 *     - parent: The name of the plugin this plugin extends. Since Drupal 7 this
 *       is no longer required, but may still be useful from a code readability
 *       perspective.
 *     - no ui: Set to TRUE to denote that the plugin doesn't appear to be
 *       selectable in the ui, though on the api side they still exists.
 *     - uses options: Set to TRUE to denote that the plugin has an additional
 *       options form.
 *     - help: A short help text, wrapped in t() used as description on the plugin settings form.
 *     - help topic: The name of an entry by advanced help for the plugin.
 *     - theme: The name of a theme suggestion to use for the display.
 *     - js: An array with paths to js files that should be included for the
 *       display. Note that the path should be relative Backdrop root, not
 *       module root.
 *     - type: Each plugin can specify a type parameter to group certain
 *       plugins together. For example all row plugins related to feeds are
 *       grouped together, because a rss style plugin only accepts feed row
 *       plugins.
 *
 *   - Used by display plugins:
 *     - admin: The administrative name of the display, as displayed on the
 *       Views overview and also used as default name for new displays. Wrap in
 *       t().
 *     - no remove: Set to TRUE to make the display non-removable. (Basically
 *       only used for the master/default display.)
 *     - use ajax: Set to TRUE to allow AJAX loads in the display. If it's
 *       disabled there will be no ajax option in the ui.
 *     - use pager: Set to TRUE to allow paging in the display.
 *     - use more: Set to TRUE to allow the 'use more' setting in the display.
 *     - accept attachments: Set to TRUE to allow attachment displays to be
 *       attached to this display type.
 *     - contextual links locations: An array with places where contextual links
 *       should be added. Can for example be 'page' or 'block'. If you don't
 *       specify it there will be contextual links around the rendered view. If
 *       this is not set or regions have been specified, views will display an
 *       option to 'hide contextual links'. Use an empty array if you do not want
 *       this.
 *     - uses hook menu: Set to TRUE to have the display included by
 *       views_menu_alter(). views_menu_alter executes then execute_hook_menu
 *       on the display object.
 *     - uses hook block: Set to TRUE to have the display included by
 *       views_block_info().
 *     - theme: The name of a theme suggestion to use for the display.
 *     - js: An array with paths to js files that should be included for the
 *       display. Note that the path should be relative Backdrop root, not
 *       module root.
 *
 *   - Used by style plugins:
 *     - uses row plugin: Set to TRUE to allow row plugins for this style.
 *     - uses row class: Set to TRUE to allow the CSS class settings for rows.
 *     - uses fields: Set to TRUE to have the style plugin accept field
 *       handlers.
 *     - uses grouping: Set to TRUE to allow the grouping settings for rows.
 *     - even empty: May have the value 'even empty' to tell Views that the style
 *       should be rendered even if there are no results.
 *     - theme file: Name of the file containing theme or preprocess functions.
 *     - theme path: Location of the theme file and template files needed
 *         relative to the Backdrop root.
 *
 *   - Used by row plugins:
 *     - uses fields: Set to TRUE to have the row plugin accept field handlers.
