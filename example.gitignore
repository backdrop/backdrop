# To use this file simply copy it to .gitignore, and it will cause files like
# your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be excluded from git source
# control.  This is a common strategy to avoid accidentally including private
# information in public repositories and patch files.
#
# A .gitignore file was included in Backdrop core for versions 7.2 through 7.8.
# As of Backdrop 7.9, this is no longer the case, and any changes made to your
# .gitignore file will no longer be overwritten by core updates.

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.

# If you prefer to store your .gitignore file in the sites/ folder, comment
# or delete the previous settings and uncomment the following ones, instead.

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
