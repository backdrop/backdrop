CHANGELOG for field_group for Drupal 7

Views 7.x-1.x-dev
    o #962072 by mori: Improve CSS for horizontal tabs & accordion.
    o Changed Fieldgroup API: defaults and instance_settings are now merged.
    o Changed save action so everything is gathered during form_state to 
      postpone saving until the save button is hit.
    o Changed some important variable name, so it makes more sense and easier to read.
