History:
  Field_group was written for Drupal 7. For drupal 6, the module is 
  located in the CCK module (http://drupal.org/project/cck).
  As drupal core has a fields API drupal > 6, the field_group module 
  is considered a contribution.
  
Description:
  field_group is a module that will group a set of fields. In Drupal7, 
  with fields, one means all fields that come from fieldable entities.
  You can add fieldgroups in several types with their own format settings.
  field_group has API functions to add your own formatter and rendering for 
  it. 
  One of the biggest improvements to previous versions, is that fieldgroups
  have unlimited nesting, better display control.
  Note that field_group will only group fields, it can not be used to hide 
  certain fields since this a permission matter.
