Place downloaded and custom layouts in this directory to ensure clean separation
from Backdrop core and to facilitate safe, self-contained code updates.
Contributed layouts from the Backdrop community may be downloaded at
https://backdropcms.org/layouts.

It is safe to organize layouts into subdirectories to ensure easy maintenance
and upgrades.

In multisite configuration, layouts found in this directory are available to all
sites. In addition to this directory, shared common layouts may also be kept in
the sites/all/layouts directory and will take precedence over layouts in this
directory. Alternatively, the sites/your_site_name/layouts directory pattern may
be used to restrict layouts to a specific site instance.
