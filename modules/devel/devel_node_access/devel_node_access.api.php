/**
 * Explain your records in the {node_access} table.
 *
 * In order to help developers and administrators understand the forces
 * that control access to any given node, the DNA module provides the
 * Devel Node Access block, which lists all the grant records in the
 * {node_access} table for that node.
 *
 * However, every Node Access module is free in how it defines and uses the
 * 'realm' and 'gid' fields in its records in the {node_access} table, and
 * it's often difficult to interpret them. This hook passes each record
 * that DNA wants to display, and the owning module is expected to return
 * an explanation of that record.
 *
 * The explanation should not be localized (not be passed through t()), so
 * that administrators seeking help can present English explanations.
 *
 * @param $row
 *   The record from the {node_access} table, as object. The member fields are:
 *   nid, gid, realm, grant_view, grant_update, grant_delete.
 *
 * @return
 *   A string with a (short!) explanation of the given {node_access} row,
 *   to be displayed in DNA's 'Devel Node Access' block. It will be displayed
 *   as HTML; any variable parts must already be sanitized.
 *

 *
 * If this is unavoidable, a module can confess to being the owner of these
 * grant records, so that DNA can properly attribute them.
